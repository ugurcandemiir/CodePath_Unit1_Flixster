# Flix

Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

In this assignment, we'll be extending our Flicks app to allow users to get more information about a particular movie in a movie details screen. Then, we'll add a tab bar to allow users to view movies in a grid view (Collection View) from different endpoints of the MovieDB API.
